basecamp_notify
===============

A super-simple Capistrano recipe that hooks into your deploy process and
posts new messages to your project's Basecamp account on each deploy,
containing the abbreviated commit logs of each commit between the last deploy
and the current deploy.

INSTALLATION:

* Stick it in yourapp/vendor/plugins/basecamp_notify
* Copy the example configuration containing your sensible Basecamp login data
  from examples/basecamp.yml into config/basecamp.yml and adjust the contents.
  (And ignore it via .gitignore)

USAGE:

In basecamp.yml you can additionally define a specific category for each stage and 
you can format the the title of the message by using "title_format".
The "title_format"-string can include the following placeholders:

* %r for the current_revision
* %p for the defined prefix
* %a for the application
* %s for the stage

KNOWN ISSUES:

* Only works with git and subversion.
* No error checking, really. Although the Subversion part falls back to a standard
  `svn log` if the XML parsing fails
